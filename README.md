Week 3: React.js, JSX, and Tailwind CSS – Mastering Front-End Development
🚀 Objective

Build a responsive React application using JSX and Tailwind CSS that demonstrates component architecture, state management, hooks usage, and API integration.

📂 Tasks
**Task 1: Project Setup**
Create a new React application using Vite
Install and configure Tailwind CSS
Set up the project structure with components, pages, and utility folders
Configure basic routing using React Router
**Task 2: Component Architecture**
Create reusable UI components:
Button component with different variants (primary, secondary, danger)
Card component for displaying content in a boxed layout
Navbar component for site navigation
Footer component with links and copyright information
Implement a layout component that includes the Navbar and Footer
Use props to make components customizable and reusable
**Task 3: State Management and Hooks**
Implement a TaskManager component that allows users to:
Add new tasks
Mark tasks as completed
Delete tasks
Filter tasks (All, Active, Completed)
Use the following hooks:
useState for managing component state
useEffect for side effects (e.g., loading saved tasks)
useContext for theme management (light/dark mode)
Create a custom hook (e.g., useLocalStorage) for persisting tasks
**Task 4: API Integration**
Fetch data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder)
Display the fetched data in a list or grid layout
Implement loading and error states
Add pagination or infinite scrolling
Create a search feature to filter the API results
**Task 5: Styling with Tailwind CSS**
Create a responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
Implement a theme switcher (light/dark mode) using Tailwind's dark mode
Use Tailwind's utility classes for layout, spacing, typography, and colors
Create custom animations or transitions for interactive elements
🧪 Expected Outcome
A fully functional React application with multiple components
Proper state management using React hooks
API integration with loading and error handling
Responsive design implemented with Tailwind CSS
Clean, well-organized code following React best practices
